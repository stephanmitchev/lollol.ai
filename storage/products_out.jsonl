Coated in a 100% plant-based, food-safe wax finish. The wooden handle features a hole to loop and hangs for easy storage. This board is designed for transport and serving only, do not place it in the oven. Note: The handle may move and is designed as such to allow your wood board to expand and contract with changes in the surrounding humidity and temperature. More humid air will cause wood to expand; drier air will cause the wood to contract. When washing your board, the wood can also expand. Therefore, the handle is purposefully not glued in. Otherwise, the board runs the risk of warping and will never regain its original design. These serving boards are intended for serving only and should not be used for cutting or chopping. To protect and preserve the integrity and longevity of the piece, we recommend using a barrier such as parchment paper, a plate or a bowl for non-dry and hot ingredients.

The raw clay is left untouched on the bottom, while the top portion is dipped twice: the interior features a warm, cream glaze on the inside and a bright, white glaze on the outside for the perfect mix of traditional design and contemporary style. The baking dish heats evenly throughout, ensuring a perfectly cooked recipe every time. These durable pieces easily handle all your one-dish baking, roasting and broiling needs and is meant for everyday use as these pieces are easy to clean and resist chips. These stoneware bakers have endless possibilities and can also be used for serving as it moves from the oven to the table seamlessly without the need to transfer your meal to another dish. Skip the oven altogether, and this casserole dish can be used as a statement serving tray. From beginning to end, each piece requires approximately 35 hours of work.

This is a desired effect to enhance the individuality of each piece. Crazing does not affect the quality or durability of the item.

The raw clay is left untouched on the bottom, while the top portion is dipped twice: the interior features a warm, cream glaze on the inside and a bright, white glaze on the outside for the perfect mix of traditional design and contemporary style. The baking dish heats evenly throughout, ensuring a perfectly cooked recipe every time. These durable pieces easily handle all your one-dish baking, roasting and broiling needs and is meant for everyday use as these pieces are easy to clean and resist chips. These stoneware bakers have endless possibilities and can also be used for serving as it moves from the oven to the table seamlessly without the need to transfer your meal to another dish.

His new book, aptly titled More Beautiful, picks up where the first left off, in a celebration of classic, all-American decorating. The rooms featured in More Beautiful are divided into five distinct styles, all of which exude the happiness that comes with surrounding oneself with things you love. \"Traditional\" is chockablock with vibrant color, antique furniture, and heady doses of trim and pattern. \"Country\" is a new take on the style, where distressed finishes and modern silhouettes mingle for a warm welcome. \"Coastal\" is streamlined, with natural woven fibers, sun-faded linen and neutrals, and blues and whites galore. \"Mediterranean\" evokes faraway lands, with a saturated palette, ornate tiles and ikats, and iron details. Finally, there's \"Beautiful\": a peek inside Mark's own Hollywood Hills home, which nods to all of his favorite design signatures--including Italian wicker, blue and white, Anglo-Indian antiques, and more. With all-new photography by Amy Neunsinger, the book will inspire with rooms that are light-filled and crisply patterned, chic yet comfortable, and just the way people want to live today.The author of Beautiful is back with a new book of his interiors, filled with blue-and-white vignettes, wicker, saturated color, and pretty patterns. Interior designer Mark D. Sikes burst onto the publishing scene with his New York Times best-selling first book, Beautiful. His new book, aptly titled More Beautiful, picks up where the first left off, in a celebration of classic, all-American decorating. The rooms featured in More Beautiful are divided into five distinct styles, all of which exude the happiness that comes with surrounding oneself with things you love. \"Traditional\" is chockablock with vibrant color, antique furniture, and heady doses of trim and pattern. \"Country\" is a new take on the style, where distressed finishes and modern silhouettes mingle for a warm welcome. \"Coastal\" is streamlined, with natural woven fibers, sun-faded linen and neutrals, and blues and whites galore. \"Mediterranean\" evokes faraway lands, with a saturated palette, ornate tiles and ikats, and iron details. Finally, there's \"Beautiful\" a peek inside Mark's own Hollywood Hills home, which nods to all of his favorite design signatures--including Italian wicker, blue and white, Anglo-Indian antiques, and more. With all-new photography by Amy Neunsinger, the book will inspire with rooms that are light-filled and crisply patterned, chic yet comfortable, and just the way people want to live today.

But the beloved silhouette, replete with graceful wood-cut details and looping fretwork, has remained a high-society staple, perfect for palatial Palm Beach dining rooms, breezy seaside cottages, and decor schemes ranging from Chinoiserie to classic Americana. Here our artisans have recreated the chair in white lacquered mahogany with a comfortable drop-in cushion. A true conversation piece around a dining table.
