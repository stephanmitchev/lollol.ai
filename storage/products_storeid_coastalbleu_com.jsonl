Hand-crafted from reclaimed wood, this pizza board’s modern yet functional design can also double as a decorative kitchen accent. Distinguished by a center strip of contrasting timber, this modern yet functional design allows the board to maintain its structural beauty throughout. Coated in a 100% plant-based, food-safe wax finish. The wooden handle features a hole to loop and hangs for easy storage. This board is designed for transport and serving only, do not place it in the oven. Note: The handle may move and is designed as such to allow your wood board to expand and contract with changes in the surrounding humidity and temperature. More humid air will cause wood to expand; drier air will cause the wood to contract. When washing your board, the wood can also expand. Therefore, the handle is purposefully not glued in. Otherwise, the board runs the risk of warping and will never regain its original design. These serving boards are intended for serving only and should not be used for cutting or chopping. To protect and preserve the integrity and longevity of the piece, we recommend using a barrier such as parchment paper, a plate or a bowl for non-dry and hot ingredients. Dimensions \u0026 Care: 19\" L x 13\" W x 1.2\" H To prevent and resolve surface stains, wipe the surface clean with hot soapy water immediately after using and then dry with a clean, dry dish towel.

Our pieces are inspired from antique molds collected from classic 19th century European kitchens. The raw clay is left untouched on the bottom, while the top portion is dipped twice: the interior features a warm, cream glaze on the inside and a bright, white glaze on the outside for the perfect mix of traditional design and contemporary style. The baking dish heats evenly throughout, ensuring a perfectly cooked recipe every time. These durable pieces easily handle all your one-dish baking, roasting and broiling needs and is meant for everyday use as these pieces are easy to clean and resist chips. These stoneware bakers have endless possibilities and can also be used for serving as it moves from the oven to the table seamlessly without the need to transfer your meal to another dish.

But second homes are far from a novel concept.

Homes on the water have been coveted and cherished for their particular restorative qualities. In an oceanside house, one can't help but pause to contemplate the view. At Home on the Water offers a history of coastal living and features twelve homes on the water on both coasts and the gulf. This stunning title focuses on both the design of the homes and the way the homeowners live in them, embellished by interviews with homeowners, designers, and\/or architects.Coastal havens designed for laid-back living.

Case in point: the Loop Side Chair, an elegant seat based on the iconic design of Frances Adler Elkins, one of the most prominent female furniture designers of the 20th century. Elkins introduced the Loop Chair in the 1930s, and only created eight in total. But the beloved silhouette, replete with graceful wood-cut details and looping fretwork, has remained a high-society staple, perfect for palatial Palm Beach dining rooms, breezy seaside cottages, and decor schemes ranging from Chinoiserie to classic Americana. Here our artisans have recreated the chair in white lacquered mahogany with a comfortable drop-in cushion. A true conversation piece around a dining table.

{"id":"gid:\/\/shopify\/Product\/7384705859764","title":"Breton Chair - Driftwood","description":"With the Breton Collection, the craftsmen have taken a classic shape and energized it using fresh mixed materials. The result is a complementary selection of seats that make a sophisticated impression with an air of casual cool. Here, the Breton Chair cuts a fine figure in Cape Lilac Mahogany, with a driftwood finish that boldly underscores the natural grain of the wooden frame. Its back boasts a screen of lacquered hand-tied caning, with a form-fitting curve to ensure ultimate comfort. Metallic accents speak to our artisans’ eye for detail, with hand-cast brass sabots and armcaps providing a luxurious finish touch. The Breton is an ideal choice for a dining set, and would fit well in anything from an urban loft space to a rustic country home.
